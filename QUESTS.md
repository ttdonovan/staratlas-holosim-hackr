# GHOST PROTOCOL: INFILTRATION SEQUENCE

## Chapter 0: "Digital Awakening"

**Mission: Setup Development Environment**

_The neural implants are installed, but raw. You must prepare your consciousness for interface with the quantum networks._

* Install Rust (your primary weapon - fast, secure, unbreakable)
* Install Solana CLI (your gateway to the blockchain networks)
* Install Bun (lightning-fast execution for real-time operations)

## Chapter 1: "Decoding the Architecture"

**Mission: Familiarize with Documentation**

_Every network has its own language. Before you can infiltrate, you must speak fluent protocol._

* Client code generated from Codama (reverse-engineering the faction communication protocols)

```bash
# just codama-create-idl
# just codama-generate-rs
```

* Understanding the data structures that bind the galaxy together

```bash
$ just doc-holosim
```

## Chapter 2: "Eyes in the Void"

**Mission: Observe the Galaxy**

_A ghost must see without being seen. Time to tap into the data streams._

* Solana RPC to get program accounts (scanning faction assets and positions)

```bash
$ cargo run -p holosim-examples --example ch2_get_accounts
```

* Solana RPC pubsub to watch program activity (real-time surveillance of fleet movements and transactions)

```bash
$ cargo run -p holosim-examples --example ch2_pubsub_accounts
```

## Chapter 3: "First Contact" (upcoming)

**Mission: Choose Your Faction**

_The time for observation ends. Which banner will you serve?_

```bash
# TODO
```
